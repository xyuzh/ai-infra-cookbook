const e=`# Wide EP Fault Tolerance

Demonstrates data-parallel (DP) group fault tolerance and autoscaling for MoE LLM serving with Ray Serve. Uses gang-scheduled DP deployments where all workers in a DP group are restarted atomically when one fails.

Check out the [blog post](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/dp-group-fault-tolerance-vllm-wideep-ray-serve-llm) for a detailed walkthrough of the Wide EP Fault Tolerance feature.

## The stack

| Layer | Library | Role in this example |
|---|---|---|
| Serving | [Ray Serve LLM](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/llm/index.html) | gang-scheduled DP deployments with atomic group restart |
| Inference | [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) | MoE inference engine with data_parallel_size=2 |
| Load testing | [Locust](https://github.com/locustio/locust) | constant and shaped load patterns for the fault/autoscaling demos |
| Environment | [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) | runs the load generator with inline deps |
| Platform | [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com) | image build, compute provisioning, job/service management |

## Install the Anyscale CLI

\`\`\`bash
pip install -U anyscale
anyscale login
\`\`\`

## Install \`uv\`

\`\`\`bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
\`\`\`

## Deploy the service

Clone the example from GitHub.

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/anyscale/ai-infra-cookbook.git
cd ai-infra-cookbook/wide_ep_fault_tolerance
\`\`\`

Deploy the service. By default it uses \`microsoft/Phi-tiny-MoE-instruct\` with autoscaling enabled (\`num_replicas: auto\`).

\`\`\`bash
anyscale service deploy -f service.yaml
anyscale service wait --name wide-ep-fault-tolerance --state RUNNING --timeout-s 600
\`\`\`

Set \`SERVICE_URL\` and \`SERVICE_TOKEN\` from the deploy output:

\`\`\`bash
export SERVICE_URL=<SERVICE_URL>
export SERVICE_TOKEN=<SERVICE_TOKEN>
\`\`\`

## Fault tolerance demo

Start constant traffic in one terminal:

\`\`\`bash
uv run --with locust --with requests run_locust.py \\
    --host $SERVICE_URL \\
    --token $SERVICE_TOKEN \\
    --traffic-pattern constant \\
    --baseline-users 10
\`\`\`

In another terminal, kill a random GPU worker process via the service's \`/simulate-fault\` endpoint:

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_TOKEN" $SERVICE_URL/simulate-fault
\`\`\`

Observe recovery:

- The **Locust output** shows a brief spike in errors as the affected DP group tears down.
- The **Service dashboard** shows replica count drop then recover.
- The surviving DP group continues serving requests throughout.

## Autoscaling demo

Run a shaped traffic pattern to trigger scale-up/down:

\`\`\`bash
uv run --with locust --with requests run_locust.py \\
    --host $SERVICE_URL \\
    --token $SERVICE_TOKEN \\
    --traffic-pattern varying \\
    --baseline-users 5 \\
    --peak-users 40
\`\`\`

The load test runs a 14-minute shaped traffic pattern (baseline -> ramp up -> peak -> ramp down -> baseline). The service autoscales when traffic pattern shifts. Watch replica count change in the services tab.

## Understanding the example

- This example is built with [Ray Serve LLM](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/llm/index.html), leveraging vLLM as the engine and Ray Serve as the orchestration framework to deploy LLM applications at scale.
- \`service.yaml\` deploys \`microsoft/Phi-tiny-MoE-instruct\` with \`data_parallel_size: 2\` and \`num_replicas: auto\` (autoscaling between 1-4 DP groups, 2 ranks per group).
- \`kill_worker_proc.py\` is deployed as a separate Ray Serve application at \`/simulate-fault\`. It uses \`nvidia-smi\` to find a GPU process on a random worker node and kills it with \`SIGKILL\`.
- Ray Serve gang scheduling ensures that if one worker in a DP group fails, the entire group is torn down and restarted together — preventing partial failures from leaving the deployment in an inconsistent state.

## Shutdown

\`\`\`bash
anyscale service terminate --name wide-ep-fault-tolerance
\`\`\`
