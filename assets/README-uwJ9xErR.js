const e=`# Streaming Video Curation with Ray Data

This example builds a multimodal video curation pipeline with [Ray Data](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/data.html) on [Anyscale](https://anyscale.com). It turns raw videos into clean, semantically-annotated clip datasets in a single streaming pipeline where CPU and GPU stages run concurrently with automatic backpressure.

## The stack

| Layer | Library | Role in this example |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration | [Ray Data](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/data.html) | streaming execution across heterogeneous CPU/GPU stages with backpressure |
| Inference | [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) | serves Qwen2.5-VL for per-clip category/safety/description annotation |
| Embeddings | [CLIP ViT-B/32](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-B-32) | 512-d clip embeddings computed on a CPU actor pool |
| Dataset | [FineVideo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFV/finevideo) | source video dataset, streamed without local prefetching |
| Platform | [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com) | image build, compute provisioning, job/service management |


## Pipeline

Videos are streamed directly from the [HuggingFaceFV/finevideo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFV/finevideo) dataset, eliminating the need for local prefetching. Each video is split on-the-fly into multiple clips, which are then streamed, processed, and written to Parquet format.

    +--flat_map(process_video_bytes)    # 1 video -> ~10 clips
    |     scene detect + quality filter + keyframe extraction (fused)
    |
    +--vLLMEngineProcessor              # 1:1, attaches category/is_safe/desc
    |     Qwen2.5-VL-3B, one replica per GPU
    |
    +--filter(is_safe)                  # drops unsafe rows
    |
    +--map_batches(CLIPEmbedder)        # 1:1, attaches 512-d embedding
    |     CLIP ViT-B/32 on CPU actor pool

Each \`.py\` file has per-stage IO comments, see [\`video_curation.py\`](video_curation.py) for the full data-flow narrative.

The key idea is **streaming execution with heterogeneous resources**. Traditional staged pipelines run one stage at a time, GPUs sit idle during CPU stages. This pipeline chains all five stages so CPU and GPU work run concurrently:

[Ray Data](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/data.html) executes each operation on the specified compute type, streams data block-by-block between operations, and applies backpressure automatically.

## Install the Anyscale CLI

\`\`\`bash
pip install -U anyscale
anyscale login
\`\`\`

## Clone the example

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/anyscale/ai-infra-cookbook.git
cd ai-infra-cookbook/video_curation
\`\`\`
## Submit the job

[FineVideo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFV/finevideo) is a gated Hugging Face dataset, so you **must** set the \`HF_TOKEN\` environment variable.  
Pass your Hugging Face token to the job using the \`--env\` flag to enable dataset access.

\`\`\`bash
export HF_TOKEN=hf_...

# Run the job on 20 videos
anyscale job submit -f job.yaml --env HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN --env NUM_VIDEOS=20
\`\`\`

To run the job on the full dataset, simply omit the \`NUM_VIDEOS\` flag.

## Understanding the example

- This example uses two models: [Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct) for semantic understanding and [CLIP ViT-B/32](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-B-32) for embedding computations. Both models are public and automatically downloaded from Hugging Face.
- This workload creates curated parquet files that are saved to \`/mnt/shared_storage/finevideo/curated/streaming_<timestamp>/\`.
